A program that converts archives downloaded by BDFR into Lemmy DB queries.  

Can be used to archive subreddits. 

Please note that this program is currently a mess. The program makes alot of DB reads/writes, there is basically no error handling, and everything is in a single file.  
It will be cleaned up more in the future.
